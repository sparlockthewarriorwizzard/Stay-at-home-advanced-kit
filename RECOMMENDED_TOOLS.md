# 🛠 Recommended Tools for "Vibe Coding"

To get the most out of this starter kit, we recommend a toolchain built for AI collaboration.

## 🧠 The "Brain" (IDE)
Use an IDE that supports **MCP** and **Context Awareness**:

1.  **Cursor** (Mac/Windows/Linux)
    *   *Why?* Best-in-class Composer mode, native terminal AI, and excellent indexing of your codebase.
    *   *Setup:* Install the "React Native" extension pack.

2.  **Windsurf** (Mac/Windows/Linux)
    *   *Why?* "Flow" mode proactively runs commands and fixes errors. Great for "hands-off" coding.

3.  **VS Code + Cline** (Open Source)
    *   *Why?* Use any LLM you want (Anthropic, OpenAI, Local models) with full autonomous capabilities.

## 🖥 The Terminal
1.  **Warp**
    *   *Why?* The "AI Command Search" (`#`) lets you write natural language like "undo last git commit" and it generates the command for you.

## 🌐 The Browser
1.  **Arc Browser**
    *   *Why?* "Browse for Me" feature summarizes tech docs instantly.
    *   *Dev:* Excellent split-view for having localhost and Supabase dashboard side-by-side.

## 📱 Simulator
- **Orbit** (formerly Expo Orbit)
    - Quickly launch Android Emulators and iOS Simulators from your menu bar.
