# Product Guidelines

## Content & Voice
*   **Empowering & Bold:** The tone of the app should be strong and motivating. All copy, from button labels to the AI-generated affirmations, should inspire confidence and action in the user. Avoid passive or overly gentle language; prioritize "Manifestation" and "Creation."
*   **Conciseness for Rhythm:** AI affirmations must be short and punchy. This ensures they can be easily quantized and looped within the 16-step sequencer without sounding cluttered or requiring excessive time-stretching.

## Visual Design
*   **High-Contrast Neon:** The primary aesthetic is a dark background with vibrant neon accents. Use thin, glowing lines and glowing button states to create a sharp, high-tech, and futuristic atmosphere.
*   **Neon for Function:** Neon highlights should be used to indicate active states, such as the playhead on the sequencer or the "Recording" status.

## Interaction Design
*   **Template-First Sequencing:** The sequencer should lower the barrier to entry by providing professional musical templates. Users should be able to start with a high-quality "base" track and focus on integrating their voice and making minor adjustments rather than building from scratch.
*   **Intuitive Creation:** While the interface looks high-tech, the interactions should be simplified. Minimize technical music production jargon in favor of intuitive controls.

## Social & Sharing
*   **Social-Ready Exports:** Prioritize the export of high-quality audio and video formats optimized for platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The "output" of the app should be something the user is proud to show off.
*   **Collaborative Remixing:** Foster a community by allowing users to share their sequences as templates. Other users should be able to take these musical structures and record their own affirmations over them, creating a culture of shared manifestation.
