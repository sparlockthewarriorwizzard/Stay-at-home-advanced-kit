# Initial Concept
Able Music is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) that combines voice recording (user affirmations) with a beginner-friendly 16-step sequencer. Users record a short vocal phrase, which is treated as a "sample" triggered rhythmically alongside pre-made drum loops and melodies on a grid interface. The flow involves inputting a goal, receiving an AI-generated affirmation, recording it, and then using that recording in a step sequencer to create a personalized track.
