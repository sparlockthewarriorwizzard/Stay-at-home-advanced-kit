# 🚀 AI-First Startup Guide

Welcome to the **React Native AI Starter Kit**. This repo is designed to be "driven" by an AI Assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Gemini).

To get started immediately without configuring anything yourself, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Clone & Open
Clone this repo and open the folder in your AI-powered IDE.

> 🛠 **Setting up your environment?**
> - Read [AI_COFOUNDER_PLAYBOOK.md](./AI_COFOUNDER_PLAYBOOK.md) for the strategy and prompt templates.
> - Read [RECOMMENDED_TOOLS.md](./RECOMMENDED_TOOLS.md) for the best IDE choices.
> - Read [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md) if you want to give your AI "superpowers".

## Step 2: The "Activator" Prompt
Copy and paste the command below into your AI Chat to initialize the project context correctly.

> **"I am setting up this codebase. Please read `.ai-instructions.md` to understand our tech stack and rules. Then, run `npm install` to set up dependencies. Once done, explain what the `src` folder structure contains."**

## Step 3: Configure Secrets
The AI might tell you this, but don't forget:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your **Supabase** and **RevenueCat** keys.
